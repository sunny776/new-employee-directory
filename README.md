# Employee-Directory# Unit 19 React Homework: Employee Directory

## Overview

For this assignment, I had to create an employee directory with React. This assignment required me to break up the application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. Employee data was generated with the randomuser.me API.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.


## Directions
* Copy and paste the reposityory and in the project directory, you can run:

* npm start
- Runs the app in the development mode.
- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

* The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.## License
